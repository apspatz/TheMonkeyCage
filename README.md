# TheMonkeyCage

For this project, our inspiration was the Infinite Monkey Theorem, which states that, given an infinite number of monkeys with typewriters and enough time, eventually they will produce the works of Shakespeare. This theorem has been used for statistical analysis and machine learning.

We decided to use this concept to create a program to write not just in the style of Shakespeare, but in the styles of other famous historic figures. We seeded our system with six different texts:
1. The Complete Works of Shakespeare
2. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
3. The King James Bible
4. The Odyssey and the Iliad
5. Dante's Divine Comedy
6. The lines of Yoda from the first six Star Wars films

With these texts, we were able to produce texts using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict sequences of characters based on the previous characters from a prompt.  For example, with the prompt "Being a mother-freakin sorceror" and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, our program produced the following text:

"Being a mother-freakin sorceror, she had
returned. He came
to the mystery.”

“Oh, Mr. Holmes?” she cried, “well?” And then, so I took out right away behind a verdict of ‘Death
from a lady, so I offered to
tell you, all the peculiar man, furthe facts came out, it was mistancies myself. She will not be able to knock you up so early, doctor—as no doubt you think me much chafficy, and you
are failed on is sheet of foolsce only compete then.
We had deserve lost in order to projecting home for drawing your advice.”
